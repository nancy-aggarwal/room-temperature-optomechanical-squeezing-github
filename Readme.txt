This data and code is being made openly available for easy reproducibility of the work reported in this manuscript. Any derived work from this code should acknowledge the funding sources and authors.

The folder IPythonNotebook contains an interactive iPython notebook that was used to process all data and create figures in the paper. It was built and used in the Jupyter Notebook interface on Windows 10. This ipython notebook has also been converted to a simple python script for those without access to ipython, this is in the folder PythonScript. All code uses Python 3. The script imports raw measurements from the folder Measurements; the numerical model from the folder Model; and saves figures and corresponding data in the folder called Results.

If you simply desire to download the figures and data generated by this code, you can directly get that from the Results folder.

Rest of the documentation is provided inside the code.
